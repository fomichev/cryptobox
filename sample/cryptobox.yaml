note:
  - 'Cory Doctorow: Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom':
      text: I lived long enough to see the cure for death; to see the rise of
            the Bitchun Society, to learn ten languages; to compose three
            symphonies; to realize my boyhood dream of taking up residence in
            Disney World; to see the death of the workplace and of work.

  - Another fragment from the same book:
      text: Some duration into my foray, he cocked his head at me and raised a
            sun-bleached eyebrow. “You get any closer, son, and we’re going to
            have to get a pre-nup.”

            I was apparent forty or so, and I thought about bridling at being
            called son, but I looked into his eyes and decided that he had
            enough realtime that he could call me son anytime he wanted.
            I backed off a little and apologized.
